list of improvements
1)the code is not organized enough
2)when u convert midi file to a pianoroll, are the dimensions the same 
3)Ignore warnings to make code cleaner 
4)the video file is basically unprocessed. To process it, use the instructions on this paper-

5)figure out how to acc get the output to midi 
6) the dataset that the model was trained on to convert mp3 to midi, was trained on piano notes. 
If you could change the tone of the notes to sound more guitaresque, then the model trained would be a lot more accutate than it is rn
